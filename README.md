# Early-Warning Modelling of Behavioural and Cognitive Risk

MSc Data Science thesis project (University of Milano-Bicocca)  
Erasmus research at Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT)

## Focus
This project investigates early-warning modelling of behavioural and cognitive risk
using smart-home sensor data in ageing-in-place environments.

## Data
Smart-home event data (CASAS-style datasets).
Raw data are not shared due to privacy constraints.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and temporal windowing
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
- Representation learning using deep learning models
- Downstream risk and anomaly modelling

## Status
Ongoing research (Nov–May 2026). Code and documentation will be updated incrementally.
